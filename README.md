# LittleThings
Updated: Mar 8, 2021

Beta Version: 1.3

***
WHAT:

LittleThings is a productivity and time management lists app. It utilizes the "One-Three-Five" rule to prioritize your days, and jog down important tasks that needs to be tackled right now. By using this rule in your day to day life, it will help to focus your time on things that you want to get done, instead of things you just happened to get through. 
***

WHY:

I created this app to help myself stay on top of my days without being overwhelmed or distracted. There are many powerful and multi functional tasks app out on the app store. However, they are so powerful that I sometimes find myself wasting time on things like customizing folders or analyzing my own progress in different bar graphs. I sometimes would get stressed out about the never ending list that just keeps on getting longer and longer, and that is why I created LittleThings. 

She is full of personality and wit. Her interactive feedback messages are so snarky it would make me laugh. She is like a super cute little pocket monster who eats tasks. Last but not least, she is simple and easy to use.
